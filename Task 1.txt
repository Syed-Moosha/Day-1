My perspective on difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
_____________________________________________________

HTTP 1.1 was introuced in 1997. During this period Internet landscape was constantly changing with websites
 becoming more dynamic and heavy.
Features like CORS, Keep-alive (most important one) was introduced in this update.  

Flaws in HTTP 1.1 :-
1) HOL works when ever the client request URL TCP connection is connected betwwen the client and server.
Initially it's one server for example when you need index.html file internally it require the js and css file 
as it a single TCP connect it will wait response of that and once it received the next respose will be sent.
In the senario TCP connection gets blocked till the response is received
Note:- write now there is six TCP connection however now a days website are huge
2)Repeation of header data - HTTP is a state less connection in which every request depended of previous and next request.
Each request has to carry on its own data like cookie,cache. Header cannot be compressed.
3)Keep-alive option enables re-using of the same TCP connection for multiple HTTP request.


HTTP 2 was introduced in 2015. HTTP 2 is an 1.1 connection with some additional Features.
One Secured TCP connection is setup in which HTTP request are Transferred in form of steams.

Features of HTTP 2 :-
1) HPACK header data is seprae from request data and can be zipped.
2)HPACK also enable reuse of header data whci is repeated in every request.
3)HPACK reduces HTTP request size.
4)PUSH frames enables us to send mandatory resources in advace along with an HTTP response
5)PUSH frames should be used with care as this can lead to increase in size of the HTTP response.      


Abbriabbreviations:-
HTTP  => Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTPS => Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
TCP   => Transmission Control Protocol
CORS  => Cross-origin resource sharing
HOL   => Head of Line Blocking
