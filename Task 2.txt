My perspective on Objects and its internal representation in javascript
_______________________________________________________________________

Objects are important data types in javascript.
It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax.
Every object has some property associated with some value. 
These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.

Example:-

var mymobile = new Object();
mymobile.launchdate ='2016, Sep 07';
mymobile.display = 'LCD';
mymobile.os = "Android 7";
mymobile.ram = "4GB";
mymobile.battery = "3200 mAh";


After creating mymobile object, the value inside the object can be accessed using keys.

i.e.
console.log(mymobile.battery);

output:-
3200 mAh


The syntax for adding a property to an object is :

ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

The syntax for deleting a property from an object is:

delete ObjectName.ObjectProperty;

The syntax to access a property from an object is:

objectName.property        
           //or
objectName["property‚Äù]     
           //or
objectName[expression]
